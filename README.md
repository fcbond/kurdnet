# KurdNet - the Kurdish WordNet

KurdNet is the the Kurdish WordNet. WordNet has been used in numerous natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation and information extraction with considerable success. Motivated by this success, many projects have been under taken to build similar lexical databases for other languages.

The current version of KurdNet is created following the Expand Approach, which is carried out semi-automatically and centred around building a Kurdish alignment for Base Concepts, i.e. the core subset of major meanings in the Princeton WordNet. Additionally, we use a bilingual dictionary and simple set theory operations to translate and align synsets and use a corpus to extract usage examples. The effectiveness of our prototype database is evaluated via measuring its impact on a Kurdish information retrieval task.

## Contribute to this project âœ¨

The current version of KurdNet only contains synsets and translations in Sorani. Since 2014 when we initiated this project, we have been looking for people interested in translating the current definitions and synsets into other variants of Kurdish, particularly Kurmanji. If you can contribute to this project, please get in touch. You can take a look at the glosses to be translated in the [Translated_Glosses.tsv](Translated_Glosses.tsv) file.
